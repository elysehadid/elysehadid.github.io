# Portfolio for Elyse Hadid and Elyse Hadid Consulting

This is a multi-purpose portfolio for my job hunt, freelance clients, and consulting work.

## Tech stack

I love JavaScript (and React!) but I wanted to provide an experience that doesn't require JavaScript. I also wanted to make sure the website loads as fast as possible and progressively enhanced.

This is a static website built with HTML and CSS. I progressively enhance the user experience with a Google web font for browsers that support it, and I use best practices to serve images in WebP format when possible. I also use this CSS reset from Josh Comeau to ensure the experience is consistent across browsers.

## Design

The design of the page was inspired by Josh Comeua, Wistia, and my friend Nicole Gathany's portfolio.

The website features a one-page layout with a sticky sidebar. For desktop users, I can almost guarantee that my contact info is available at all times. For mobile users, I wanted to ensure that the information about me on is legible, concise and easy to digest.


### Copy

Since I primarily work with non-technical people, I wanted them to be able to navigate the website with ease. For the most part, all you need to do is read and scroll down to get all of the information you need about me.

The copy is laid out sequentially to establish trust and credibility for prospective clients and employers. I open up with a short introduction about my past work, what I'm doing currently, and what I hope to do in the future, followed by:

* a link to my resume
* an overview of services I offer
* examples of my work
* context around my volunteer work
* a call-to-action
* contact info

In my footer, I list out my contact info in text just in case users aren't familiar with the social media icon links used at the bottom of the sidebar.

Ideally, this information addresses any objections that people may have about working with me. They can see my breadth of experience, my passion for the industry as evidenced by my volunteer work, and they have multiple calls to action to get in touch if they are interested in working with me.
