# Portfolio for Elyse Hadid and Elyse Hadid Consulting

This is a multi-purpose portfolio for my job hunt, freelance clients, and consulting work.

## How to install and run this project

Since this is a static website, you can download the repo and open `index.html` with the browser of your choice. Ta-da!

## Tech stack

This is a static website built with plain old HTML and CSS.

I love JavaScript (and React!) but I wanted to provide an experience that doesn't _require_ JavaScript. I also wanted to make sure the website loads as fast as possible and progressively enhanced.

I progressively enhance the user experience with a Google web font for browsers that support it, and I use best practices to serve images in WebP format when possible. I also use a CSS reset created by Josh Comeau to ensure the experience is consistent across browsers.

## Design and layout

The design of the page was inspired by [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/), [Wistia](https://wistia.com/), and my friend [Nicole Gathany's](https://nicolegathany.com/) portfolio.

The website features a one-page layout with a sticky sidebar. For desktop users, I can almost guarantee that my contact info is visible, or not too far off-screen, at all times. For mobile users, I wanted to ensure that the copy is legible, concise and easy to digest.

### Color scheme

This website has some not-so-subtle easter eggs and cues to my gender identity. I am a demisexual transwoman. I specifically use black and purple in reference to the [demisexual flag](https://www.flagcolorcodes.com/demisexual). The purple used for headings and links comes from the demisexual flag, and the projects featured in the Work section use the colors of the [transgender flag](https://www.flagcolorcodes.com/transgender).

### Copy

Since I primarily work with non-technical people, I wanted them to be able to navigate the website with ease. For the most part, all you need to do is read and scroll down to get all of the information you need about me.

The copy is laid out sequentially to establish trust and credibility for prospective clients and employers. I open up with a short introduction about my past work, what I'm doing currently, and what I hope to do in the future, followed by:

- a link to my resume
- an overview of services I offer
- examples of my work
- context around my volunteer work
- a call-to-action
- contact info

In my footer, I list out my contact info in plain text just in case users aren't familiar with the social media icon links used at the bottom of the sidebar.

Ideally, this information addresses any objections that people may have about working with me. They can see my breadth of experience, my passion for the industry as evidenced by my volunteer work, and they have multiple calls to action to get in touch if they are interested in working with me.

## Challenges

This project is stripped down to its essentials to get me in the practice of working iteratively. The goal was to get started right away writing markup with very little emphasis on planning or foresight. Additionally, traditional advice from [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/) is to use a template for your portfolio. However, since this portfolio is trying to do so many things, I felt compelled to create and design my own.

Some of the challenges I faced include:

- Finding design inspiration to mimick and build off of
- Finding a font/typeface that felt professional and still had a sense of whimsy
- Narrowing down information to include about myself so the site is easy to skim
- Meeting/maintaining WCAG color contrast standards while still being able to make the site colorful
- Writing simple CSS that is easy to extend and refactor
- Avoiding hosting any media; I don't use a CMS for assets or content, so I had to get creative in a few places
- Avoiding getting stuck: I opted to roll with whatever I end up making instead of being a perfectionist

## Planned changes and updates

- Add a picture of myself!
- Add testimonials from previous clients
- For each project: add info about the tech stack, platforms and libraries I used
- Turn this website into a template that can be re-used by my fellow devs at [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/)!
